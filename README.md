# eBirdCBC

## Purpose

Christmas bird counts are a long-standing tradition in the birding community, but data methods have been slow to keep up with modern technology. The goal of this project is to provide a nice user experience for using eBird in Christmas bird counts. 

eBird has become the standard method for collecting bird observation data, so it would be nice if birders could continue to use methods as similar as possible to their past experience on CBCs. 

## Method

One idea is to just take a single, day-long eBird checklist for each count area. This works well when all participants are together, but as soon as a group splits and the possibility to double-count birds appears, the "long checklist" approach fails. 

We suggest that counters (birders on CBCs) take as many checklists as possible (with comments on individual species and the checklist level!) and deal with the compiliation details after the fact (using this program...). That way, more time can be spent looking for birds and less on determining whether birds are double counted or not. 

Here are the times when we suggest counters start a new list:
- When a group splits or joins (i.e. when two people split to go on two different trails)
- Going on a new trail (even if the party stays constant)
- Changing habitats (i.e. going from walking around lagoon to a seawatch)

## eBirdCBC Compiler

The main advantage of using this app vs. manually downloading the eBird data is that we scrape the tracks from the checklists and display them on a map.
